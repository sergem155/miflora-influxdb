# miflora-influxdb
query Xiaomi Mi Flora plant monitors, extract hourly historical data and push into influxdb. Requires python3

```sh
$ sudo python3 scan.py
```

Poll for data:
```sh
$ ./poll-insert.py
$ ./poll-insert.py device1 device2 device3
```

```sh
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ sudo pip3 install influxdb
